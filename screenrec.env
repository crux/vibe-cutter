# ==================================================================================
# Screen Recording Transcoding Configuration
# Optimized for screen captures with UI/text content
# ==================================================================================

# --- Encoding Settings ---
# PRESET affects the encoding speed vs. compression ratio.
# Options: ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow
# 'medium' provides good balance between speed and compression for screen content
PRESET="medium"

# Video codec - h265 (libx265) provides excellent compression for screen recordings
VIDEO_CODEC="libx265"

# CRF (Constant Rate Factor) controls the quality. Lower values mean higher quality.
# For screen recordings with text/UI, CRF 28-32 is often sufficient for good readability
# while achieving significant file size reduction.
# Range: 18 (high quality) to 32 (smaller files, still readable)
CRF="30"

# --- Audio Settings ---
# Re-encode audio to AAC at moderate bitrate (typical for voice/system audio in screen recordings)
# Use 'copy' if you want to preserve original audio without re-encoding
AUDIO_CODEC="aac"

# --- Video Resolution ---
# Target resolution for output. The script maintains aspect ratio while scaling down.
# Current options:
#   - 1280x720: Good for most viewing, ~60% size reduction
#   - 1920x1080: Higher quality, ~40% size reduction
#   - Leave blank to keep original resolution (1718x1068)
TARGET_RESOLUTION="1280x720"

# --- Subtitle Settings ---
# Leave blank for screen recordings (typically no subtitles)
SUBTITLE_LANGUAGE=

# ==================================================================================
# NOTES:
# - h265 encoding is slower than h264 but produces much smaller files
# - Screen content compresses very well due to large uniform areas
# - Adjust CRF up (e.g., 32) for even smaller files, or down (e.g., 26) for higher quality
# - For 1920x1080 output (better quality), change TARGET_RESOLUTION="1920x1080"
